## What It Does

When a user asks about buying or comparing Apple products, this skill:

1. **Fetches official specs** from Apple.com via `felo-web-fetch`
2. **Searches user opinions** on X (Twitter) via `felo-x-search`
3. **Researches community & professional reviews** via `felo-search`
4. **Produces a structured report** — single product or head-to-head comparison
5. **Saves the report automatically** to a local `.md` file and, when available, to Felo LiveDoc

## Trigger Conditions

Activates when users:
- Mention an Apple product model by name (e.g. "iPhone 17", "MacBook Pro M4", "iPad Air 13")
- Use a comparison pattern: `[Model A] vs [Model B]` (e.g. "iPhone 17 vs iPhone 17e")
- Ask about buying, upgrading, or choosing between Apple products
- Ask "Should I buy a MacBook Pro?", "Is iPhone 16 Pro worth it?", "Which Apple Watch should I get?"

## Key Features

✅ **Fresh data** — All specs fetched live from Apple.com via `felo-web-fetch`; never from training knowledge
✅ **felo-web-fetch enforced** — All URL content retrieval goes through `felo-web-fetch` exclusively
✅ **Multiple sources** — X, Reddit, MacRumors forums (personal) + 9to5Mac, The Verge, CNET (professional)
✅ **Two report modes** — Single product analysis or A vs B head-to-head comparison
✅ **Balanced** — Separates personal user feedback from professional reviews
✅ **Clear recommendations** — Specific buying conditions with overall rating
✅ **Multilingual** — Responds in the user's input language
✅ **Auto-save workflow** — Always writes a local markdown report; also saves to Felo LiveDoc when configured

## Report Formats

**Single product:** Product Positioning → Specs Comparison → Real User Feedback → Professional Reviews → Buying Recommendation

**A vs B comparison:** Head-to-Head Specs → User Feedback per product → Professional Verdict → Who Should Buy Which

## Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `felo-web-fetch` | Fetch all URLs (Apple specs pages, review sites) |
| `felo-x-search` | Real-time user reactions on X/Twitter |
| `felo-search` | Reddit, MacRumors forums, professional review sites |
| `felo-livedoc` | Create a LiveDoc and save the final report for sharing/reference |

## Save Behavior

After generating the report, the skill must complete a save step before ending:

- Always save the full report to a local file named `apple-buy-advisor-<product-slug>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`
- If `FELO_API_KEY` is configured, also create a Felo LiveDoc entry and save the report there
- If LiveDoc save succeeds, the user is reminded they can open it at `https://felo.ai/livedoc/<short_id>`
- If `FELO_API_KEY` is missing, LiveDoc save is skipped and the user is told why

## Trusted Sources

| Category | Sources |
|----------|---------|
| Personal reviews | X/Twitter, Reddit (r/apple, r/[product]), MacRumors Forums |
| Professional reviews | 9to5Mac, The Verge, CNET, Tom's Guide, Engadget |

## Quick Setup

### Step 1: Install

```bash
npx skills add Felo-Inc/felo-skills --skill apple-buy-advisor
```

Or manually copy to your skills directory:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
cp -r apple-buy-advisor ~/.claude/skills/

# Windows (PowerShell)
Copy-Item -Recurse apple-buy-advisor "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\"
```

### Step 2: Install required skills

This skill depends on four other Felo skills. Install them all:

```bash
npx skills add Felo-Inc/felo-skills --skill felo-web-fetch
npx skills add Felo-Inc/felo-skills --skill felo-search
npx skills add Felo-Inc/felo-skills --skill felo-x-search
npx skills add Felo-Inc/felo-skills --skill felo-livedoc
```

### Step 3: Get API Key

1. Visit [felo.ai](https://felo.ai) and log in
2. Click your avatar → **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create New Key** and copy it

### Step 4: Configure

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export FELO_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Make it permanent
echo 'export FELO_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:FELO_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Restart Claude Code to load the environment variable.

`FELO_API_KEY` is also used for the optional Felo LiveDoc auto-save step.

### Step 5: Test

```
Should I buy the iPhone 17?
```

If you get a structured report with specs and reviews, plus a saved local `.md` file, you're all set.
